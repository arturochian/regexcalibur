\		escape character, used to match special characters (and not interpret them
		as regex). Special characters are + ? . * ^ $ ( ) [ ] { } | \
		Example: '\(\w*\?\)' matches (yeah?), (is it?), etc.

?		modify a regex to be "non greedy" or "lazy".
		Example: 	.*\\ would match the entire expression
				path\to\files\
				.?\\ given the same input would only match
				path\


(?=)	Lookahead, makes sure a given string matches a certain pattern, THEN
		matches a regex. Can be strung together.
		Example: To make sure a string contains at least one uppercase letter
		and at least one number in any order:
		^(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d).* matches Abc1, 1ABC, a1Bc, etc.

(?!)	Negative lookahead, makes sure a given string DOES NOT match a certain
		pattern, THEN matches a regex. Can be strung together.
		Example: Extending the example above to not include a period
		^(?!.*\.)(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d).* matches a1Bc but NOT a.1Bc
